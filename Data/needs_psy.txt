Satisfiers:
Violators: claim to be satisfying needs, yet in fact make it more difficult to satisfy a need.
Pseudo Satisfiers: claim to be satisfying a need, yet in fact have little to no effect on really meeting such a need.
Inhibiting Satisfiers: those which over-satisfy a given need, which in turn seriously inhibits the possibility of satisfaction of other needs.
Singular Satisfiers: satisfy one particular need only. These are neutral in regard to the satisfaction of other needs.
